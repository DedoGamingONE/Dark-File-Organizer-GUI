# 📁 Dark File Organizer GUI

A sleek drag-and-drop file organizer built with **Python + PyQt6**, featuring:

- 🗁️ Drag-and-drop folder support  
- 🗂️ Auto-sorting by **common name** and **file type**  
- 🗽 File **preview before organizing**  
- 📊 Progress bar and logging  
- 🌑 Dark theme UI  
- 🪤 Fuzzy matching to group similar filenames (e.g. `Dog01`, `dog_2`, `Doggo-03`)
- 🔄 Undo last organization
- ⚖️ Manual review and confirmation before sorting
- 💡 Custom sorting rule editor (coming soon)

---

## 🔧 How It Works

This tool scans a selected folder and:

1. Groups files by a common prefix, ignoring trailing patterns like `(01)`, `[01]`, `_01`, `-01`, and uses **fuzzy matching** to cluster similar names.
2. Creates subfolders based on that prefix.
3. Separates files by type within those folders.
4. Handles duplicate files by **renaming** with a timestamp.
5. Allows optional **manual review** and **undo** of the last operation.

### 🧱 Example structure:
```
📁 dog
 └── 📁 jpg
     ├── Dog01.jpg
     ├── dog_2.jpg
     └── Doggo-03.jpg
```
